Tutorials and sample code using the d3.js library:

the d3/ and lib/ folders are copied from the d3.js github repository and are
only included here to make the samples run standalone.  You should really
replace all references to the d3 lib files with pointers to the actual d3.js
repository either on your local machine or hosted elsewhere.
